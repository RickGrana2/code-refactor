Code-Refactor

In order for the Horiseon website to be optimal, HTML, along with CSS, were utilized to improve website accessibility. Updating certain semantics allows for easier communication to audiences.

By applying these changes not only helps to consolidate the code, but cleans it up as well.

I provided specific comments to allow future developers to see what changes have already been made, but improvements can always be made and encouraged. 

What I enjoy about this project is how each component, large or small, has a role to play. It demonstrates the importance of patience and verifying that all code is placed with a purpose and correctly. This has definitely been a great foundation to learn from.
